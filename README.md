🤖 Wikipedia Info Retrieval & Page Suggestions with KNN Clustering

🔍 Introduction:
Welcome to my GitHub repository! 🚀 As part of my exciting journey into the world of Machine Learning, I present to you a project that combines the power of information retrieval and suggestion systems using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering algorithm.

🌐 Project Overview:
This repository houses a Wikipedia Information Retrieval and Page Suggestion System, designed to streamline access to the wealth of knowledge on Wikipedia. The primary objectives are efficient information retrieval and personalized page suggestions, all achieved through the implementation of KNN clustering.

🎯 Key Features:

Information Retrieval: Seamlessly fetch relevant information from Wikipedia's extensive database.
KNN Clustering: Leverage the KNN algorithm for efficient clustering of similar pages.
Page Suggestions: Dynamically suggest related Wikipedia pages based on user input, enhancing user exploration.
🧠 Why KNN?
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is at the heart of this project for its ability to classify data points based on proximity, making it an ideal choice for clustering and suggesting related content.

💻 How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
